The word ‘Alkasir’ is the English transliteration of الكاسر, which is the Arabic word for ‘the circumventor’ or ‘the breaker’ as a way to metaphorically signal its main task of breaking digital firewalls. 

It was originally developed by Walid Al-Saqaf, a Yemeni software developer who had been subjected to censorship himself and decided to start a movement to confront and map censorship in the Arab world, which explains the source of its naming.

Today however, Alkasir allows users around the world to circumvent (bypass) censorship of URLs and simultaneously, helps keep track of patterns of URL blocking. It is predominantly used by persons in countries where there is censorship of political content such as news, opinion articles, blog entries, forum discussions, political videos, etc., but can also be used in any other country.

The first version of Alkasir was launched in May 2009 as a Windows close-source application and ever since, it has grown and expanded in its new generation Alkasir 2.0 to become an open-source multi-platform solution that can work on MS Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

About the technology
Alkasir creates an encrypted tunnel to one of Alkasir's proxy servers using Shadow Socks, an open-source Socks5 solution. To obfuscate traffic, it deploys the obfs4 pluggable transport created by the Tor Project.
