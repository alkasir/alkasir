You can find advanced settings under the Setting menu of the Chrome extension.

The following two options exist:

1) Blocked list updates: 
Here, you can keep your client up-to-date as regards the list of URLs found to be blocked by your ISP. You can do this by ensuring that the checkbox next to "Check for blocklist automatically" is checked. If you uncheck this box, you will no longer get updates from the central database and when therefore need to report a blocked URL every time you want to access it.

2) Advanced feature:
To keep the list of blocked URLs up-to-date, we rely on Alkasir 2.0 users to allow using their devices to check if a status of a particular URL has changed, for example if it has been blocked or unblocked. You can be part of this group of users by marking the checkbox next to "Allow alkasir to use this computers internet connection to run additional censorship detection tests." If you prefer not to help keep track of the blocking status of URLs, you can opt-out by unckecking that box. Only URLs that you personally report would then be accessed through your device.
