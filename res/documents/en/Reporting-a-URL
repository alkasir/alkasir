When a user suspects that a particular active URL is blocked, the following steps need to be taken to report it:
1) Open the URL in a new tab while Alkasir is active 
2) While on that tab, click on Alkasir Chrome extension icon
3) You will find a link in the purple box asking you to report problems with viewing the URL, click on 'Continue'
4) You will then taken to a page asking you to confirm sending the URL to the database for analysis
5) On the next page, you will be informed that the website has been added and you can reload the page in an attempt to open it
6) If it opens, this means the URL was indeed blocked. If not, it may be a problem with the website itself. Note that an analysis on the server will then commence to identify if the URL is indeed blocked or not and mark it accordingly.
