Below are the instructions to follow when setting up Alkasir 2.0 for the first time:
1) Once you have downloaded thec correct compressed file of Alkasir 2.0, run it to decompress. This will result in the creation of an executable file that would sit in the same folder where the compressed file is. The name would be alkasir.exe for MS Windows platforms, alkasir.app for MacOS and alkasir for Linux OS.
Furthermore, a home directory to keep configuration files will be saved, often in the home directory where personal files are kept. It would be called .alkasir . This folder is created only the first time the application runs and will only be updated with every new version of the application.
2) Once the red icon is available on the system tray, click on it and choose: open in web browser.
3) You will then find a window with a message asking you to setup Alkasir. Click 'Continue'.
4) Identify the language you wish to use and the country where you are based and click 'Continue'. This information will help optimize the configurations.
5) You will then be taken to a page indicating that you have install a browser extension. Proceed to the provided link and install the Alkasir 2.0 Chrome extension as required.
6) Once the browser extension is installed, you will find Alkasir's icon on the Chrome tab (next to the address bar).
7) When you click on the icon, you should see two fields one in Green indicating that Alkasir is working (if it is indeed working) and one below it in purple, asking you to report the URL in the active tab if it is not accessible.
8) At this stage, you are connected to Alkasir proxy server and have an encrypted tunnel established and ready for use.
