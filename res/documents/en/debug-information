Sending debugging information
Because Alkasir 2.0 is in constant development, you may find that it may not be working as required. 
In case you do, please follow these three simple steps to send us the debugging information to identify potential application errors:
1. Do NOT turn off the client, for security reasons the debugging information is never stored to disk so it is important to keep the client running.
2. Visit http://localhost:8899/api/debug/ in your Chrome browser. You will then be asked to download a file locally.
3. Email us on <debug@alkasir.com> describing what went wrong and attach the file you just downloaded. Please describe what you did so we could try reproducing the bug to fix it.
