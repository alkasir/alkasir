Limitations

Alkasir is no holy grail and does have its limitations that could be summarized in the following:

1) Alkasir circumvents some and not all blocked content

Alkasir does not grant access to all blocked websites. Although we strongly believe in freedom of expression and access to information, we have decided to limit what alkasir could be used. We have ended up creating a strict yet clear policy that guides our decisions on whether to allow access to a specific website or not. The policy is not fixed so it is advised that users check it every once in a while for any changes. Some may consider this a restriction in its own right, but we simply view it as a regulating policy that would prevent the abuse of alkasir's servers. If users do not agree on this policy, they are welcome to send their comments and suggestions and we will be happy to provide suggestions for alternative software.

2) Requires Chrome 

Unlike other circumvention tools, Alkasir depends on Chrome due to the need for internal functionality provided byt the browser to adjust the proxy settings and keep the list of blocked websites up-to-date. This is a temporary limitation as we plan to introduce plug-ins to other major browsers.

3) Not an anonymizer

We want to ensure that whoever is using Alkasir understands that it does not anonymize traffic. It only encrypts traffic to and from URLs that are blocked. This means that all other websites are in the clear and traffic to them is not encrypted (unless they are using SSL). Furthermore, it is also possible to detect if Alkasir is being used due to the logo and identified proxy servers it uses. However, the traffic tht goes through the tunnel is encrypted and cannot be seen by the ISP or others. We wish to emphasize however that we never save IP addresses or any personal meta data that could directly identify a particular device or user on the Internet.

4) Work in progress

Although version 2.0 of Alkasir is a tremendous leap forward, it remains in beta mode so we cannot guarantee that it will not crash or show some awry behavior. We constantly work on improving it so please ensure that you have the latest version. We welcome receiving bug reports to help us identify and fix bugs as soon as possible.

5) Mobile version still not ready

Though we had hoped to have a mobile version of the software available, we just couldn't manage until now mainly due to the complexity of the split-tunneling mechanism that Alkasir relies on. One of our main objectives for 2016 however, is to launch the mobile iOS and Android versions.
